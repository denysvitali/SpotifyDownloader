# SpotifyDownloader
A Spotify song and playlists downloader

# WARNING
The code actually is ultra dirty (provided as is) - and it's actually not a Node package

## Requirements
- Node.JS
- eyeD3
- spotify-web
- lame
- fs
- node-fs
- path
- request
- colorize
- string_decoder
- asyncblock

No help is given at the moment, I have to completly rewrite it as a Node module. Sorry.
